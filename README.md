## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-03

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-29
### Fixed
- Use a single user-home cache location (`~/.faceless/models`) for YOLO model downloads to prevent cwd-based re-downloads.

### Added
- Write `main.log` and `error.log` under userdata and expose CLI log inspection commands.
- Require Python `3.10+` for installation and runtime.

### Added
- Prompt to open the source folder after each run, then optionally open `labels`.

### Fixed
- Parse YOLO label files correctly when UTF-8 BOM or integer-like class tokens are present.

### Changed
- Align packaged version and release tag at `0.2.1`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-28
### Added
- Route non-matching media into label-based subfolders under the configured output directory.
- Route non-matching media into group-based subfolders using prioritized YAML group definitions.
- Enforce mutual exclusivity between `-Auto` and `-Group`.

### Fixed
- Resolve `-Auto` folder names from YAML mappings or model metadata instead of `class_<id>` fallbacks.
