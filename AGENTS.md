# AGENTS.md

This file is the canonical in-repo guide for coding agents and developers working on Faceless.

## Project Purpose

Faceless is a CLI tool that uses YOLO object detection to separate image files that do not contain both faces and some set of yolo classes.

Files that fail this rule are moved into a destination folder (default: `noface`) under the source directory.

## Repository Layout

- `faceless/__init__.py`: Main CLI logic and processing loop.
- `faceless/__main__.py`: Module entry point (`python -m faceless ...`).
- `scripts/Invoke-Label-Faceless.ps1`: PowerShell helper for label generation with YOLO.
- `labels/`: Dataset and class-group metadata YAML files.
- `pyproject.toml`: Packaging metadata and Python dependencies.
- `faceless.spec`: PyInstaller one-file executable build configuration.

## Key Packages

Runtime packages:

- `ultralytics`: Runs YOLO inference and writes YOLO txt labels.
- `argparse`: Built-in CLI parser. Keep CLI parsing based on argparse built-ins.
- `pathlib` (stdlib): Path normalization and filesystem operations.
- `shutil` (stdlib): Moves unmatched files.

Packaging/dev packages:

- `setuptools`, `wheel`: Build backend.
- `pyinstaller`: Builds standalone Windows executable from `faceless.spec`.
- `build`: Optional package build tooling.

Notes:

- `pyproject.toml` currently requires Python `>=3.10`.
- `mise.toml` pins local toolchain to Python `3.12`.

## Runtime Behavior and Patterns, actual behaviour will differ. 

### Base CLI contract, actual behaviour will differ. 

Current parser in `faceless/__init__.py` supports:

- positional source path: `python -m faceless <path>`
- `-Path` / `--path`
- `-Label` / `--label`
- `-Conf` / `--conf`
- `-Directory` / `--directory`

### Label generation phase

Labels are generated when either condition is true:

- label folder does not exist at `<source>/labels`
- `-Label` is explicitly provided

Generation uses `YOLO(...).predict(...)` with project output set to source and label files stored in `<source>/labels`.

### Filtering/move phase

Per source file:

1. Read `<source>/labels/<stem>.txt` if present.
2. Detect whether both class constraints are present.
3. If both are not present, move the file to `<source>/<directory>`.

Current class constants in code:

- girl/woman classes: `216`, `594`
- human face class: `264`

## Change Guidelines

- Keep CLI parsing in `parse_arguments()` on argparse built-ins only.
- Preserve backward compatibility for existing PowerShell-style flags where practical.
- Use `Path(...).expanduser().resolve()` for user-provided paths.
- Prefer explicit, actionable parser errors for invalid/missing CLI input.
- Keep image-processing behavior deterministic; avoid adding hidden side effects.
- Keep edits minimal and focused. Avoid unrelated refactors.

## Validation Checklist

When modifying behavior, validate all of the following:

1. `python -m faceless <path>` works.
2. `python -m faceless -Path <path>` works.
3. `--help` reflects all options and defaults.
4. Labels are produced in `<source>/labels` when forced or missing.
5. Non-matching files move to the configured destination directory.

## Build and Execution

Install dependencies:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run as module:

- `python -m faceless "<path>"`

Run via script entry point:

- `faceless "<path>"`

Build executable:

- `pyinstaller faceless.spec`

## Known Operational Gotchas

- Environment mismatch can cause `No module named faceless` if the wrong Python interpreter is used.
- File moves are destructive to original folder layout; test against a copy of data when changing logic.
- The source directory may contain non-image files; current logic iterates all files and relies on label presence.
